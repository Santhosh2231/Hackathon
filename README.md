AgroVision is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing the way farmers choose crops and make decisions about their farming operations. With the use of cutting-edge technology and machine learning algorithms, AgroVision provides farmers with a comprehensive and accurate picture of their farm's potential. This includes soil analysis, location-based data, and rainfall information, which can be used to determine the most suitable crops for a given area.

## Features of the Project
1. Crop Prediction based on Locality and seasons.
2. Crop Prediction based on the soil fertility
3. Crop Price Prediction.
